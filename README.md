# Cool-Snake-Game---Free-to-Use

**Description:**

A modern and significantly enhanced implementation of the classic Snake game, built purely with web technologies (HTML Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript). This project goes beyond the basics, incorporating a sleek user interface and several engaging features:

*   **Dynamic UI:** Utilizes advanced CSS for a visually appealing interface with gradients, animations, and responsive design elements.
*   **Difficulty Levels:** Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard settings before starting, directly impacting the snake's speed.
*   **Pause & Resume:** Seamlessly pause and resume gameplay using the 'P' key.
*   **Persistent High Scores:** Tracks the highest score achieved using browser `localStorage`, displayed prominently.
*   **Leveling System:** The game difficulty increases dynamically as your score rises, increasing the snake's speed up to a maximum level.
*   **Theming:** Switch between multiple visual themes (e.g., Default, Blue, Green, Red) affecting the game's color palette and background.
*   **Sound Effects:** Includes basic audio feedback for eating food and game over (toggleable).
*   **Enhanced Visuals:** Features rounded snake segments, a head with simple eyes, and pulsing food for better visual cues.
*   **Wrap-Around Gameplay:** The snake wraps around the screen edges instead of crashing into walls.
*   **Clear Controls:** Supports both Arrow Keys and WASD for movement, with on-screen instructions.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of using HTML Canvas for game development, combined with modern CSS and JavaScript for interactive features and state management. It's free to use and modify as long as the owner [https://github.com/Destructive-Entity] is credited.
