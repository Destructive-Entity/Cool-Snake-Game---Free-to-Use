**Description:**

A modern and significantly enhanced implementation of the classic Snake game, built purely with web technologies (HTML Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript). This project goes beyond the basics, incorporating a sleek user interface and several engaging features:

*   **Dynamic UI:** Utilizes advanced CSS for a visually appealing interface with gradients, animations, and responsive design elements.
*   **Difficulty Levels:** Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard settings before starting, directly impacting the snake's speed.
*   **Pause & Resume:** Seamlessly pause and resume gameplay using the 'P' key.
*   **Persistent High Scores:** Tracks the highest score achieved using browser `localStorage`, displayed prominently.
*   **Leveling System:** The game difficulty increases dynamically as your score rises, increasing the snake's speed up to a maximum level.
*   **Theming:** Switch between multiple visual themes (e.g., Default, Blue, Green, Red) affecting the game's color palette and background.
*   **Sound Effects:** Includes basic audio feedback for eating food and game over (toggleable).
*   **Enhanced Visuals:** Features rounded snake segments, a head with simple eyes, and pulsing food for better visual cues.
*   **Wrap-Around Gameplay:** The snake wraps around the screen edges instead of crashing into walls.
*   **Clear Controls:** Supports both Arrow Keys and WASD for movement, with on-screen instructions.
